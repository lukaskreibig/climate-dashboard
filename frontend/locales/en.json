Semi-structured interviews and a 2015 focus-group reveal that predictable winter sea-ice is essential for hunting, fishing and over-ice travel, yet melt-season onset now arrives several weeks earlier than in the 1990s. Only ≈ 1 % of the global literature examines coastal winter ice-thickness, the parameter most needed for safe travel, indicating a significant relevance gap. The authors conclude that climate knowledge must be co-produced with Indigenous communities to be salient, credible and legitimate for local adaptation and decision-making.",
